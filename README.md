# Getting Started with the App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the source code

1. Download the zip folder and extract it.
2. Go to the project directory and run 'npm install' (This will install required or missing dependencies).
3. Then, run 'npm start'
4. I have used bootstrap / bootswatch theme in this application. If you encounter any error related to bootstrap then:
        Inside project directory, Run 'npm install bootstrap' or  'npm install bootswatch' depending on the type of error.
5. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
